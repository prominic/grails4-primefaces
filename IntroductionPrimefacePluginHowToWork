    1. When the spring framework starting ,we need loading all bean into container.
    2. Custom the Grails4PrimeFacesConfig and implements it from GrailsApplicationAware.
       Loading the Grails4PrimeFacesConfig when the spring starting.
    3. Face all /faces/** url request map to FacesServlet , this still need force register when the spring starting.

    So yo can check these steps from Grails4PrimeFacesPluginGrailsPlugin -doWithSpring method.
